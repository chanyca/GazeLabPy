# GazeLabPy
**Development Status: ðŸš§ Under Development**  

  
GazeLabPy is a research toolkit for getting real-time eye-tracking data from Pupil Neon and updating stimulus location based on gaze coordinates. It provides tools to set up a simple experiment using Psychopy, conversion between visual degree and pixel, designed to streamline experiments involving real-time gaze-contingent stimulus presentation.

  cd pupil
  git checkout develop
  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- [Pupil Labs Real-Time API](https://github.com/pupil-labs/realtime-python-api) and [Real-time Screen Gaze](https://github.com/pupil-labs/real-time-screen-gaze) Python packages
  ```
  pip install pupil-labs-realtime-api
  pip install real-time-screen-gaze
  ```
